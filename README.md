In this article, we will learn about ADT but before understanding what ADT is let us consider different in-built data types that are provided to us. Data types such as int, float, double, long, etc. are considered to be in-built data types and we can perform basic operations with them such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, etc. Now there might be a situation when we need operations for our user-defined data type which have to be defined. These operations can be defined only as and when we require them. So, in order to simplify the process of solving problems, we can create data structures along with their operations, and such data structures that are not in-built are known as Abstract Data Type (ADT).

Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations. The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view. 

The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.
